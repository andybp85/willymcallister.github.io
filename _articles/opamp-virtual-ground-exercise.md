**What is the expected gain of a unity-gain buffer amplifier?**

{% capture summary %}show answer{% endcapture %}  
{% capture details %}  
From the video, the gain expression for the non-inverting amplifier is,

$v_o = v_{in}$  

The gain is $1$.

**Starting from a blank schematic, design and simulate an unity-gain buffer amplifier with a gain of $1$.**

Include a voltage probe on the output port.

[Circuit sandbox](https://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index.html)

**Click on TRAN to run a transient simulation.** 

Does the simulation match your gain calculation?

**Add a voltage probe to $v_{in}$ and simulate again.**

Notice how the output and input voltages overlap one another.

**Change the value of the input voltage and run TRAN again.**

Hint: Double-click on the input voltage source to modify its magnitude. 

Verify the buffer amplifier does what you expect.

**Open the data.csv file in Excel or Matlab or any text editor.**

Notice that $v_o$ and $v_{in}$ are the same. When we model an ideal opamp the virtual ground is perfect, $v_o = v_{in}$. In the real world there will be a very slight difference due to the *offset voltage* of a real opamp. You find the offset voltage listed on the opamp's data sheet.
